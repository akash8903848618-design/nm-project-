##  ReactJS Routing with Login Protection

###  Description

This project is a **ReactJS application** that implements **routing with login protection** using **React Router**. It ensures that only authenticated users can access specific pages, such as dashboards or profile sections, while unauthenticated users are redirected to the login page.
This setup mimics the structure of real-world applications that require secure access control and user session management.

###  Features

* **Protected Routes:** Restricts access to private pages for unauthenticated users.
* **Authentication Flow:** Secure login and logout functionality.
* **Persistent Login:** Maintains user authentication state using tokens or storage mechanisms.
* **Automatic Redirection:** Redirects users to the intended route after successful login.
* **React Router Integration:** Smooth, single-page navigation without page reloads.
* **Role-Based Access (Optional):** Enables different access levels for users and admins.
* **Scalable Structure:** Easy to extend for larger projects with multiple routes.

###  Technologies Used

* **ReactJS:** For building user interfaces and managing components.
* **React Router DOM:** For handling routing and navigation between pages.
* **Context API / Redux:** For managing authentication state globally.
* **LocalStorage / SessionStorage:** For storing authentication tokens securely.
* **Axios / Fetch API:** For handling API requests during login and data fetching.
* **CSS / Tailwind / Material UI:** For styling and responsive design.

###  How It Works

1. The user logs in through the login page using valid credentials.
2. Upon successful authentication, a token or user session data is stored locally.
3. A custom route protection mechanism checks whether the user is authenticated.
4. If authenticated, the user gains access to private routes (e.g., dashboard).
5. If not authenticated, the user is automatically redirected to the login page.
6. The user can log out at any time, which clears the stored session and redirects back to the login screen.

###  Challenges

* Managing authentication state consistently across components.
* Handling token expiration and automatic session logout.
* Ensuring security of stored tokens or credentials.
* Maintaining clean and modular routing logic for scalability.
* Managing redirects and preventing navigation loops.
